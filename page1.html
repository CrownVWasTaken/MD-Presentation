            <p>A class of hereditary illnesses known as Muscular Dystrophy results in gradual weakening and loss of muscle mass. It encompasses around thirty distinct medical diseases that impact the muscles, resulting in muscular weakness and associated symptoms. These illnesses are caused by mutations in certain genes that control the composition and functionality of muscles. Skeletal muscle weakening and degradation over time is a hallmark of Muscular Dystrophy. Depending on the exact kind of Muscular Dystrophy, symptoms might vary, but frequent indications include muscle weakening, trouble with motor abilities, and mobility issues. The treatment goals for Muscular Dystrophy are to improve quality of life and manage symptoms. A healthcare provider must be consulted to receive an accurate diagnosis and a customized treatment plan.</p>
